# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What This Is

A chezmoi-managed dotfiles repository for macOS. Source directory is `~/.local/share/chezmoi/`, targeting `~/` as the destination. Managed configs include shell (zsh, starship, sheldon), editor (vim, helix), terminal (ghostty, tmux, zellij), git, Claude Code (`~/.claude/`), dev tools (mise, gh, yazi), and macOS packages (Brewfile).

## Common Commands

```sh
chezmoi apply                  # Apply all dotfiles to ~/
chezmoi apply --dry-run        # Preview what would change
chezmoi diff                   # Show diff between source and destination
chezmoi add <file>             # Add a file to chezmoi management
chezmoi edit <file>            # Edit a managed file's source
chezmoi managed                # List all managed files
chezmoi data                   # Show template data (profile, ghOrg, etc.)

# Linting (mirrors CI — also runs on commit via prek)
make lint                      # Run all checks (secretlint + shellcheck + shfmt + oxlint + oxfmt + actionlint + zizmor + modify_ + script tests + templates + sensitive scan)
pnpm exec secretlint '**/*'   # Scan for leaked secrets only

# Harness analysis (scheduled weekly in CI, also manual)
gh workflow run harness-analysis.yml  # Trigger harness analysis manually
/resolve-harness-issues              # Fix open harness-analysis issues (creates branch + PR)

# Security alerts (scheduled weekly in CI, also manual)
gh workflow run security-alerts.yml  # Trigger security alert sweep manually

# Harness improvement pipeline (propose → validate → apply)
/propose-harness-improvement         # Generate structured improvement proposal from a failure
/validate-harness-proposal           # Quality-gate a proposal (generator-evaluator separation)
/apply-harness-proposal              # Apply a validated proposal (auto-apply or PR)
/harness-rule-lifecycle              # Inventory rules, detect staleness, deprecate/merge
/compound-harness-knowledge          # Document resolved issue via /ce:compound with harness context

# Continuous learning (ECC instinct system)
/instinct-status                     # View learned instincts with confidence bars
/evolve                              # Cluster instincts into skills/commands/agents
/promote-instincts                   # Promote high-confidence instincts to harness rules (manual)
/prune                               # Delete expired pending instincts (30-day TTL)
scripts/snapshot-instincts.sh        # Snapshot instincts to source tree (run before push for CI)
gh workflow run auto-promote.yml     # Trigger auto-promotion manually (weekly schedule)
```

## chezmoi Naming Conventions

Source files use chezmoi's naming scheme — understand these prefixes when working here:

| Prefix | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `dot_` | File starts with `.` in target (e.g., `dot_zshrc` → `~/.zshrc`) |
| `private_` | Target has `0600`/`0700` permissions |
| `modify_` | Script that receives current target on stdin, outputs modified version |
| `run_onchange_` | Script runs when its tracked hash changes |
| `run_onchange_after_` | Combines `run_onchange_` (hash-triggered) + ordering after file targets |
| `.tmpl` suffix | Go template — rendered with `.chezmoi.homeDir`, `.profile`, `.ghOrg` |

## Architecture

### Template Variables

Defined in `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl`, prompted on first `chezmoi init`:
- `.profile` — `"work"` or `"personal"` (controls gitconfig work overrides)
- `.ghOrg` — GitHub org name (used in permissions and directory paths)
- `.chezmoi.homeDir` — Home directory path

### Key Patterns

**`modify_dot_claude.json`** — Partially manages `~/.claude.json` (a large runtime file). Uses `jq` to replace only the `mcpServers` key from `dot_claude/mcp-servers.json`, preserving all other runtime state. This is the correct pattern for files where chezmoi should own a subset of keys.

**Declarative marketplace sync** — `dot_claude/plugins/marketplaces.txt` lists marketplace sources (one per line: `owner/repo` or URL). `run_onchange_after_add-marketplaces.sh.tmpl` tracks the file hash and runs `claude plugin marketplace add` for each entry when it changes. To add a new marketplace: register it locally with `claude plugin marketplace add`, run `scripts/update-marketplaces.sh` to regenerate the list, then commit and push. To remove: run `claude plugin marketplace remove` manually on each machine — removing a line from `marketplaces.txt` does not unregister the marketplace. Plugin install/enable state (`installed_plugins.json`, `known_marketplaces.json`) is not managed by chezmoi — these files are in `.chezmoiignore`.

**Declarative gh extension sync** — `dot_config/gh/extensions.txt` lists gh extensions (one `owner/repo` per line). `run_onchange_after_install-gh-extensions.sh.tmpl` installs them when the list changes. `scripts/update-gh-extensions.sh` regenerates the list from `gh extension list`. Same pattern as marketplace sync. Note: `gh extension list` is tab-delimited — use `awk -F'\t'` to parse.

**`run_onchange_` scripts** — Track file hashes in comments (e.g., `# brewfile hash: {{ include "darwin/Brewfile" | sha256sum }}`). They re-run only when the tracked content changes.

**Claude Code sandbox** — The `claude` shell command is wrapped by `dot_config/zsh/sandbox.zsh` to run inside a macOS Seatbelt sandbox. Primary tool is [agent-safehouse](https://github.com/eugene1g/agent-safehouse) (Homebrew, deny-all default), with [cco](https://github.com/nikvdp/cco) as fallback. Sandbox configuration lives in `dot_config/safehouse/config.tmpl` (safehouse CLI flags, one per line) and `dot_config/cco/allow-paths.tmpl` (cco path allowlist). cco is still pulled via `.chezmoiexternal.toml` for Linux fallback; `run_onchange_after_link-cco.sh.tmpl` symlinks the binary. Use `command claude` or `\claude` to bypass sandboxing.

**Automated security alert handling** — `.github/workflows/security-alerts.yml` runs a weekly Saturday sweep (schedule) and supports manual dispatch (`gh workflow run security-alerts.yml`). Uses `claude-code-action` to analyze all open security alerts (Dependabot, code scanning, secret scanning) and either auto-fix (low-risk Dependabot/code scanning → PR) or escalate (high-risk/secret scanning → issue with `security` label).

**Scheduled harness analysis** — `.github/workflows/harness-analysis.yml` runs weekly (Sunday 00:00 UTC) via `claude-code-action` to detect harness improvements, stale rules, documentation drift, refactoring candidates, and rule effectiveness. Findings are created as GitHub Issues with the `harness-analysis` label. Can also be triggered manually via `gh workflow run harness-analysis.yml`.

**Autonomous harness improvement pipeline** — Three skills form a generator-evaluator pipeline: `propose-harness-improvement` (generates structured proposals from failures), `validate-harness-proposal` (quality gates with generator-evaluator separation), and `compound-harness-knowledge` (thin wrapper delegating to `/ce:compound`). Two commands handle application: `apply-harness-proposal` (low-risk auto-apply or high-risk PR) and `harness-rule-lifecycle` (rule inventory, staleness detection, deprecation). The CI workflow `harness-auto-remediate.yml` triggers on `harness-analysis` labeled issues, running the proposal/validation pipeline via `claude-code-action` and auto-creating PRs for low-risk fixes.

**Continuous learning (ECC integration)** — Two learning paths operate in parallel. The **deterministic path** uses ECC plugin hooks (`pre:observe`/`post:observe`) to capture every tool call to `~/.claude/homunculus/projects/<hash>/observations.jsonl`. A background observer (Haiku model) analyzes observations and creates confidence-scored "instincts" (atomic learned behaviors). The **deterministic briefing path** uses `executable_learning-briefing.sh` (a `UserPromptSubmit` hook) to inject pipeline health and instincts with confidence >= 0.6 on the first prompt of each session. The bridge command `/promote-instincts` connects the two: high-confidence instincts (>= 0.7) can be promoted to permanent harness rules through the existing propose/validate/apply pipeline. Observer configuration is managed via the `CLV2_CONFIG` env var in `settings.json.tmpl`, which resolves at runtime to `~/.claude/continuous-learning-config.json` (chezmoi source: `dot_claude/continuous-learning-config.json`). Runtime state in `~/.claude/homunculus/` is excluded via `.chezmoiignore`.

**Auto-promotion (Closed-Loop v1)** — `.github/workflows/auto-promote.yml` runs weekly (Sunday 01:00 UTC) to automatically promote high-confidence instincts to rules. Requires a local snapshot: run `scripts/snapshot-instincts.sh` to copy instinct files to `dot_claude/instinct-snapshots/` (excluded from deployment via `.chezmoiignore`). The CI health gate (`scripts/validate-instinct-snapshot.sh`) checks freshness (14 days), count (>= 5), and format validity before `claude-code-action` processes candidates. All promotions create PRs (main branch is protected). Low-risk domains (code-style, file-patterns, naming, documentation) create auto-merge eligible PRs; high-risk domains create PRs requiring human review.

### `.chezmoiignore`

Extensively excludes `~/.claude/` dynamic directories (projects, sessions, cache, etc.) so only curated config files are managed. Also excludes repo-only files like `docs/`, `package.json`, `node_modules/`.

### `.chezmoiexternal.toml`

Pulls external git repos (e.g., Claudeception skill, cco) into the managed tree with auto-refresh. Each entry is pinned to a commit SHA via `ref` for supply-chain safety. Renovate auto-updates these SHAs — see `.claude/rules/renovate-external.md` for the adjacency contract that must be preserved.

### Directory Layout

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `darwin/` | macOS-specific resources: `Brewfile`, `DefaultKeyBinding.dict`, `defaults.sh` |
| `windows/` | Windows-specific resources: `alacritty.yml`, `chocolatey` |
| `.chezmoiscripts/` | All `run_onchange_` scripts live here (not in the source tree root) |
| `dot_claude/` | Claude Code config (`~/.claude/`): settings (`settings.json.tmpl`), MCP servers (`mcp-servers.json`), rules, commands, plugins, scripts (hooks), keybindings |
| `scripts/` | Repo-only helper scripts (`update-brewfile.sh`, `update-marketplaces.sh`, `update-gh-extensions.sh`) |
| `docs/solutions/` | Past problem resolutions — search here when encountering similar issues |

### Pre-commit Hooks

Uses `prek` (not husky) with `secretlint` to prevent committing secrets. Dependencies managed via pnpm. The `run_onchange_install-pre-commit-hooks.sh.tmpl` script auto-installs when `package.json` or `.pre-commit-config.yaml` change.

## Verification

```sh
make lint                      # Run ALL checks locally (mirrors CI)
chezmoi apply --dry-run        # Preview changes before applying

# Individual targets (same as CI jobs):
make secretlint                # Scan for leaked secrets
make shellcheck                # Lint non-.tmpl shell scripts
make shfmt                     # Check shell script formatting (indent=4)
make oxlint                    # Lint JS/TS files (.js, .mjs, .mts, .ts)
make oxfmt                     # Check JS/TS and JSON formatting
make actionlint                # Lint GitHub Actions workflows (syntax + types)
make zizmor                    # Security audit GitHub Actions workflows
make test-modify               # Smoke test modify_ scripts
make test-scripts              # Smoke test harness scripts
make check-templates           # Validate chezmoi .tmpl files
make scan-sensitive            # Scan all .md files for PII and sensitive info
make test-sensitive            # Smoke test sensitive info scanner
```

Note: shellcheck, shfmt, oxlint, and oxfmt cannot lint `.tmpl` files (Go template syntax is incompatible). CI (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`) and local use the same `make` targets — if it passes locally, CI will pass too. For similar past issues, search `docs/solutions/`.

## Known Pitfalls

### chezmoi CLI & File Management

- **`chezmoi add --autotemplate` breaks JSON** — `:` and `/` get over-substituted. Use `chezmoi add --template` + manual `sed` for homeDir substitution instead.
- **`run_after_` scripts calling `chezmoi add` cause recursion** — Use `cp` + `sed` to write directly to the source directory.
- **`.chezmoiignore` silently skips** — If `chezmoi add` does nothing, check `.chezmoiignore`.
- **`.chezmoiignore` `*.txt` is root-level only** — `*.txt` does NOT match nested paths like `.config/gh/extensions.txt`. Use `**/*.txt` for recursive matching, or add explicit entries for nested files. Always verify with `chezmoi managed | grep <pattern>`.
- **Repo-only files need `.chezmoiignore`** — Files like `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` at repo root are excluded via `.chezmoiignore` so they don't deploy to `~/`. New repo-only files must be added there.
- **`.chezmoiignore` bare filenames match target paths** — `.chezmoiignore` evaluates target paths, not source filenames. Adding `.gitignore` blocks `dot_gitignore` → `~/.gitignore` deployment because the target path is `.gitignore`. Likewise, regular non-prefixed source files (e.g., `README.md`, `LICENSE`) are still managed by chezmoi and need explicit `.chezmoiignore` entries to prevent deployment to `~/`. `dot_`, `private_`, etc. are mapping conventions for how source names translate to targets, not a gate for whether chezmoi considers a file a source.
- **Choosing chezmoi file patterns** — Regular `.tmpl` for fully-owned files. `create_` for provision-once. `modify_` for runtime-mutable files (IDE configs). `.chezmoiignore` to exclude entirely. For files modified by external tools (plugins), prefer `.chezmoiignore` + declarative `run_onchange_` scripts over bidirectional sync.
- **Never edit deployed targets directly** — Always edit the chezmoi source file (under `~/.local/share/chezmoi/`), never the deployed target (under `~/`). For example, edit `dot_claude/scripts/executable_learning-briefing.sh`, not `~/.claude/scripts/learning-briefing.sh`. Changes to deployed targets are overwritten on next `chezmoi apply` and are not version-controlled. Use `chezmoi source-path <target>` to find the source file for any managed target.
- **`docs/` is tracked** — Both `docs/plans/` and `docs/solutions/` are committed. Plan files created by `ce:plan` and solution documents are version-controlled. Ensure no PII or sensitive information is included — `make scan-sensitive` checks all `.md` files in the repo.
- **Do not judge `modify_*` files by extension** — `modify_dot_claude.json` has a `.json` extension but is a bash script. Add `! -name 'modify_*'` exclusions to file-type-based linter/formatter globs (`*.json`, `*.yaml`, etc.). Also include `modify_` patterns in pre-commit excludes.

### Template Syntax

- **Template escaping** — To output literal `{{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}` in a `.tmpl` file, use `{{ "{{ .chezmoi.homeDir }}" }}`.
- **`chezmoi execute-template` in CI needs config + source** — `--init --promptString` only answers `promptStringOnce` prompts; it does NOT populate the `.data` namespace (`.ghOrg`, `.profile`) that templates reference. Use a test `chezmoi.toml` with `[data]` section and pass `--config <path> --source "$(pwd)"`. Also exclude `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` itself since it uses `promptStringOnce` (interactive).

### Script Safety

- **`modify_` scripts: empty stdout = target deletion** — Never use OS guards (`{{ if eq .chezmoi.os "darwin" }}`); on non-matching OS the script outputs nothing and chezmoi zeros the file. Always include `set -e`. Use `printf '%s\n'` (not `printf '%s'`) to preserve trailing newlines stripped by `$(cat)`.
- **Hook scripts: set one-shot flags after guards, not before** — When using `/tmp` flag files for "run once per session" behavior, place the `touch` **after** context guards (directory exclusions, git checks), not before. If the flag is set before guards, a non-project context (e.g., `$HOME`) consumes the one-shot flag, and navigating to a project later in the same session silently skips the hook.

### External Constraints & Tool Integration

- **Git commit signing** — Requires 1Password SSH agent (`op-ssh-sign`). Commits will fail without it running.
- **Inline hook commands: keep simple or use jq** — Inline `bash -c` hook commands in `settings.json.tmpl` have two layers of escaping (JSON `\"` + shell quoting) that are extremely error-prone. Avoid complex grep/sed patterns; use `jq` (already a dependency) or extract logic into external script files.
- **Verify GitHub Actions template output** — Workflows generated from templates (e.g., `claude-code-action`) default to read-only permissions. Posting comments requires `pull-requests: write` / `issues: write`. Do not use template output as-is — verify permissions match the intended use. See `~/.claude/rules/common/github-actions.md` for expression syntax constraints.
- **Never hardcode node/pnpm versions in CI** — All pnpm/node jobs in `lint.yml` must use `node-version-file: '.node-version'` and `packageManager` auto-detection. Direct `version:` or `node-version:` inputs are prohibited. Version sources: `.node-version` (node), `package.json` `packageManager` (pnpm).
