# Claude Code Hook Scripts

Guidance for `dot_claude/scripts/`. Moved out of the project root `CLAUDE.md` (2026-07-26) —
narrowly scoped to this directory's hooks (notification delivery, worktree seeding), so it
only needs to load when working here. See `.claude/rules/shell-scripts.md` for general
hook-script conventions.

**Notification hook ownership** — `dot_claude/scripts/executable_notify.sh` is wired to
`Notification` (permission requests, idle waits) and `StopFailure` (the turn ended because
of an API error) only. It is deliberately **not** wired to `Stop`: `Stop` fires at the end of
every assistant turn, which made notifications worthless noise. The `Notification` entry's
`matcher` filters on the payload's `notification_type`, so only
`permission_prompt|idle_prompt|agent_needs_input` reach the script and the non-blocking types
(`agent_completed`, `auth_success`, `elicitation_*`) never invoke it — the `permission_prompt`
pattern also matches `worker_permission_prompt`, which is wanted: that one is a network-access
approval dialog. The script classifies on `notification_type` as well, not on the English
prose in `message`; the message regex survives only as a fallback for a Claude Code that omits
the field, and matches `approv` (not `approve`) because the product's literal is "needs your
approval for …". Both notify entries set `"timeout": 5` so a hanging delivery backend
(`terminal-notifier` produces no output for 120s under a Seatbelt sandbox, which the
safehouse-wrapped `claude` imposes on hooks) degrades fast instead of holding the hook slot
for the 60s default. The script exits silently
when `ORCA_PANE_KEY`, `ORCA_AGENT_HOOK_PORT`, and `ORCA_AGENT_HOOK_TOKEN` are all set —
that is the exact condition under which `~/.orca/agent-hooks/claude-hook.sh` forwards the
event to orca, so orca will notify instead, with better worktree/tab attribution. Checking
`ORCA_PANE_KEY` alone would create a silent gap when orca's port or token is missing.
Notifications carry attribution (cwd basename plus git branch) and a wait kind, never a
summary of Claude's last message — the transcript is never read; a `StopFailure` body names
the API failure (`rate_limit`, `authentication_failed`, …) from the payload's `error` field.
Delivery is `terminal-notifier` (for `-group` replacement and click-to-focus) falling back to
`osascript`; **`terminal-notifier` fails silently until macOS notification permission is
granted**, and the fallback does not cover that — backend selection is
`command -v terminal-notifier`, so `osascript` runs only when the binary is absent. On a new
machine verify notifications actually arrive rather than assuming.
orca's own notification granularity is GUI-only and not version-controlled. Every
invocation that clears the suppression gates appends one line to `~/.claude/logs/notify.log`
(bounded to 500 lines) recording event, kind, `notification_type`, `error`, and message —
that log is how a misclassification gets diagnosed, and `error` is recorded separately
because `message` is always empty for `StopFailure`. Suppressed invocations log nothing, so
an empty log inside an orca workspace is the expected result rather than evidence the hook is
broken.
Design: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-25-notification-hook-redesign-design.md`.

**Worktree seeding hook** — `dot_claude/scripts/executable_worktree-include.sh` is wired to
`SessionStart` (`startup|resume|clear`) and copies the files a repository's `.worktreeinclude`
lists from the **main** worktree into the linked worktree the session is running in.
`.worktreeinclude` is git-worktree-runner's convention, but only `gtr new` acts on it — a
worktree created by orca or by plain `git worktree add` starts without the gitignored local
files a session needs (`CLAUDE.local.md`, `.claude/settings.local.json`). Firing at
SessionStart rather than at worktree-creation time is deliberate: orca exposes no
create-time hook, and the later trigger also heals worktrees that already exist.
**Copy-if-absent, never overwrite** — SessionStart fires again on every resume and `/clear`,
and Claude Code itself writes `.claude/settings.local.json` inside the worktree whenever the
user picks "always allow"; an overwriting sync would erase that on the next resume. This is
also why the hook does not simply shell out to `git gtr copy`, whose `cp` is unconditional
(and which is absent in CI). Every guard exits 0 — a missing `.worktreeinclude`, a
non-worktree cwd, a main-worktree cwd — and stdout stays empty unless a file was actually
copied, because SessionStart stdout becomes the session's additional context.
Pattern semantics deliberately diverge from gtr in one place: a **leading `/` is read as
"anchored at the repo root"** the way `.gitignore` does it, whereas gtr classifies it as an
absolute path and silently drops the line (verified: `git gtr copy --dry-run` reports
`Skipping unsafe pattern … /.claude/settings.local.json`). Those `.worktreeinclude` lines have
therefore never been honored by gtr itself; on the **work** profile the defect was masked
because `dot_gitconfig.tmpl` separately sets `gtr.copy.include = .claude/settings.local.json`,
which `gtr new` does act on — so the file appeared anyway and nobody noticed the dropped line.
`..` segments are still refused, directories are skipped (regular files
only), and `**` is not supported. `gtr.copy.include` from gitconfig is deliberately **not**
read — reimplementing gtr's merge rules would double-copy under `gtr new`.
Tested by `just test-scripts` (`test/worktree-include.bats`).
