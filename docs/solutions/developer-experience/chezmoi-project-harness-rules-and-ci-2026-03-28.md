# Project-Specific Harness Rules and CI for chezmoi Dotfiles Repository

## Problem

Agents working in the chezmoi dotfiles repository had no project-specific rules to guide them on chezmoi template patterns, shell script conventions, or verification procedures. The only lint gate was pre-commit hooks, which can be bypassed.

## Symptoms

- Agents made avoidable mistakes with chezmoi file type selection (`.tmpl` vs `modify_` vs `create_`)
- No documented way to verify changes before committing
- No CI to catch issues that bypass pre-commit hooks
- Agents confused `dot_claude/rules/` (deployed globally to `~/.claude/rules/` via chezmoi) with `.claude/rules/` (project-specific rules for the repo itself)

## What Didn't Work

- **Attempting to commit `docs/plans/` files** — `.gitignore` excludes `docs/*` with only `!docs/solutions/` as exception. Modifying `.gitignore` to add `!docs/plans/` exposed 30+ old untracked plan files, polluting the PR scope. Reverted and left plans as local working documents.
- **Using `chezmoi apply --dry-run` in CI** — Requires `.chezmoi.toml` with template variables (`.profile`, `.ghOrg`) that are environment-specific. Setup cost too high for CI; lint checks provide sufficient validation.
- **`chezmoi execute-template --init` without `--source`** — Templates using `include` (e.g., `{{ include "darwin/Brewfile" | sha256sum }}`) fail silently because `execute-template --init` doesn't know the source directory. The `--source "$(pwd)"` flag is required.
- **`chezmoi execute-template --init --promptString` does not populate `.data` namespace** — `--promptString 'ghOrg=test-org'` answers `promptStringOnce` prompts during config initialization, but does NOT set template data variables (`.ghOrg`, `.profile`). Templates referencing `.ghOrg` fail with `map has no entry for key "ghOrg"`. The fix is to use a test `chezmoi.toml` with `[data]` section and `--config` flag instead of `--init --promptString`.

## Solution

Three additions to the harness:

### 1. Project-specific `.claude/rules/`

Created `.claude/rules/chezmoi-patterns.md` and `.claude/rules/shell-scripts.md` at the repo root. These are NOT the same as `dot_claude/rules/` which deploys to `~/.claude/rules/`.

**Key distinction:**
- `dot_claude/rules/` → chezmoi source → deploys to `~/.claude/rules/` (global, cross-project)
- `.claude/rules/` → repo root → project-specific rules for this repo only (not deployed)

Content focuses on agent judgment criteria (when to use `modify_` vs `.tmpl`, `run_onchange_` hash tracking pattern, `.tmpl` shellcheck incompatibility) rather than duplicating CLAUDE.md Known Pitfalls.

### 2. CLAUDE.md Verification section

Added before Known Pitfalls with four commands:
```sh
chezmoi apply --dry-run        # Preview changes before applying
pnpm exec secretlint '**/*'   # Check for leaked secrets
shellcheck <script.sh>         # Lint non-.tmpl shell scripts
shfmt -d -i 4 <script.sh>     # Check shell script formatting
```

### 3. GitHub Actions CI (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)

Four parallel jobs: secretlint (via pnpm), shellcheck (Ubuntu pre-installed), shfmt (downloaded binary), and chezmoi template validation.

**Critical pattern:** Both shellcheck and shfmt `find` commands exclude `.tmpl` files — Go template syntax is incompatible with shell linters. This mirrors the existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` exclusion pattern.

**chezmoi template validation** uses `chezmoi execute-template --config <test-config> --source "$(pwd)"` to validate Go template syntax in all `.tmpl` files. Key details:
- A test `chezmoi.toml` is created with `[data]` section providing dummy values for `profile` and `ghOrg`. This is required because `--init --promptString` only answers `promptStringOnce` prompts — it does NOT populate the `.data` namespace that templates reference via `.ghOrg` / `.profile`
- `--source "$(pwd)"` is **required** for templates that use `include` — without it, `execute-template` cannot resolve file paths for hash computation
- `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` is excluded from validation because it uses `promptStringOnce` which requires interactive input
- Validates syntax only (output goes to `/dev/null`); does not test rendered correctness

Added `.github/` to `.chezmoiignore` to prevent CI files from deploying to `~/`.

### 4. Harness rule improvements

- **Concrete file references in `.claude/rules/chezmoi-patterns.md`** — Each pattern in the File Type Selection table now links to a real example file (e.g., `modify_dot_claude.json` for modify\_ pattern). Declarative Sync Pattern section references both marketplace and gh extension file triples.
- **CI Enforcement section in `.claude/rules/shell-scripts.md`** — Explicitly states that shell script rules are enforced by CI (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`) and pre-commit (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`), not advisory.
- **`verify` script in `package.json`** — `pnpm run verify` runs secretlint as a single entry point for validation.

## Why This Works

- **Project rules vs global rules separation** prevents agents from conflating `dot_claude/rules/` (what gets deployed everywhere) with `.claude/rules/` (guidance for working in this specific repo)
- **Verification section** gives agents a concrete validation checklist instead of relying on implicit knowledge
- **CI** catches issues that bypass pre-commit hooks (direct pushes, `--no-verify` commits) and provides a visible quality gate on PRs
- **`.tmpl` exclusion** avoids false positives from Go template syntax that shell linters cannot parse

## Prevention

- When adding project-specific agent rules to a chezmoi repo, always use `.claude/rules/` at the repo root — never add to `dot_claude/rules/` unless the rule should apply globally across all projects
- When adding new repo-only directories (`.github/`, `scripts/`), always add them to `.chezmoiignore`
- When setting up shell linting in CI for chezmoi repos, always exclude `.tmpl` files — reference `.pre-commit-config.yaml` for the established exclusion patterns
- When using `chezmoi execute-template` in CI, use `--config` with a test `chezmoi.toml` containing `[data]` section — `--init --promptString` does NOT populate the data namespace. Also pass `--source` for `include` resolution. Exclude `.chezmoi.toml.tmpl` from validation
- When adding project rules, include concrete file path references to real repository examples — agents follow patterns better when they can read the actual implementation
- Remember that `docs/plans/` is gitignored — don't attempt to commit plan files
